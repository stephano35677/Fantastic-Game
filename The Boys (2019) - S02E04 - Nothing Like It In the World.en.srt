00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,136
who used to go by the name of Liberty?

628
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:05,972
No.

629
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:08,642
Okay.

630
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:10,645
We have the right address, right?
Is that...?

631
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,698
Please leave.

632
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:26,369
Miss, I'm sorry if my friend offended you.

633
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:28,412
But we just want to ask
a couple questions.

634
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,247
Just leave me alone.

635
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:33,084
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

636
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,335
and I kept my mouth shut.

637
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:37,880
You think we're with... We're not
with Vought, okay? We... [CHUCKLES]

638
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:41,467
We want to learn what we can
about Liberty, that's it.

639
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:44,136
Then y'all are just some damn fools.

640
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,682
It sounds like you know her. Or knew her.

641
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:52,603
- You're wasting your time. Okay?
- Miss, miss, miss. Hear us out.

642
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:55,773
After that, you want us to leave, we go.

643
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:58,609
[SIGHS] Go ahead.

644
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:04,323
My father was a lawyer.

645
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:07,576
Small-time, very smart and aggressive.

646
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,413
When I was a kid, something happened
between my family and Vought,

647
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:12,498
which I'd rather not talk about,
but it was bad.

648
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,835
See, my dad, he believed in the law,

649
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,796
and that nobody was above it.
Not even Vought.

650
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:23,384
So he went to work.
He got after their asses.

651
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,138
He had one of those... You remember
those little black typewriters?

652
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,514
The manual ones with the keys?

653
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:30,433
I'd go to sleep at night
to all that noise,

654
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,143
my father banging away at that thing.

655
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,603
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

656
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:36,855
All night.

657
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:40,276
But, see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one Black man

658
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,695
put his foot on their necks, mm-mm.

659
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:46,032
So they hired teams of lawyers.

660
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:49,702
Paid off judges.
But my father never gave up.

661
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,455
Until one morning, I woke up, and...

662
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:56,584
I didn't hear those keys anymore.

663
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:01,172
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

664
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:05,134
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- [MILK] I'm not here for your sympathy.

665
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,139
But I am going to tell you
that his fight got passed down to me.

666
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,018
I'm going to make Vought pay
for what they did to him.

667
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,979
And, ma'am, from what I gather,
what they've done to you as well.

668
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:21,817
I mean, it's been 48 years.

669
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:25,196
What good is dredging
all this stuff up now gonna do?

670
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:28,824
Honestly, we don't know,
but we still need to hear it.

[SIGHS]

672
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:36,457
I tried to get people to listen.

673
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:40,377
[SCOFFS]
Lord knows, so many times, I tried.

674
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:45,758
But a little Black girl accusing
a white superhero of murder...

675
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,719
- in these parts?
- Yeah.

[VALERIE SIGHS]

677
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,933
It was during one of those summer rains...

678
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:57,853
that you just knew was coming
by the smell in the air.

679
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:05,194

<i>My brother, Myron, he was driving.</i>

00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,707
- [LIBERTY] Get out now.
- [MYRON] Hey.

685
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:21,877
Your car was involved
in a robbery tonight.

686
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:24,964
No, it wasn't. I had it.
I don't know nothing about any robbery.

687
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:27,299
[LIBERTY] Just confess.

688
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:32,304
Why are you doing this to me, lady?
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

689
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:33,889
I am a hero,

690
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:36,517
for killing a Black piece of shit
like you.

691
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,159
I wanted to go to the police.

692
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:58,164
But my folks,
they thought it was pointless.

693
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:00,416
So when that man from Vought,

694
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:03,294
when he showed up
and he offered us that money,

695
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:04,377
we just took it.

696
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,590
Two thousand dollars.

697
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:14,722
That is what my brother's life was worth,
just $2,000.

698
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:18,267
But y'all have got to promise me
that you won't tell anybody

699
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,977
that I sat here and I talked to you.

700
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,939
Because if that woman finds out that
I opened my mouth, she's gonna kill me.

701
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:28,986
Miss Hunter, that woman. Liberty...

702
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:32,698
Nobody's seen her since 1979.

703
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,408
She's probably dead by now.

704
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:39,622
Oh, no. No. I... Hold on one second.

705
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:49,298
Right here. That's her. Right there.

706
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:51,800
That's Liberty.

707
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:01,352
Valerie was a little girl, she said
it was raining, so she could be wrong.

708
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,062
She seemed pretty certain.

709
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:05,481
Yeah, but if Liberty and Stormfront
are the same person,

710
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,274
then that makes Stormfront like, what,

711
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:08,525
- 70 years old? More?
- Yeah,

00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:10,194
but who knows what Compound V can do?

713
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:13,489
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person, okay?

714
00:51:13,572 --> 00:51:16,742
It's the same Stormfront that became
America's favourite two-fisted Supe.

715
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,742
Mm-hm.

And might've popped Raynor's head
for getting too close.

- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is going on?

I didn't know that about your dad.

00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:35,678
Sounds like he was a real hero.

720
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:38,222
I thought so, but...

721
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:43,727
Nah. He was just a man with a disease.

722

Passed it down to me,

Let me tell you something right now.

00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:33,837
I built this team from the ground up,

and there is no fucking way
that anyone is gonna take it away from me.

744
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:42,262
You spent $273 million
on that "Saving America" bullshit,

745
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:44,056
and I'm running circles around you

You don't need 50 million people

I think that you
are everything we should be.

- No, Becca.

00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:19,211
You and me...
Becca, you and me, we've got a chance.

781
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:21,922
Babe, it's Ryan they care about, not us.

782
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,048
Yeah, and then what?

783
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,884
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

784
00:56:25,968 --> 00:56:28,929
Then we have Homelander again
and there's two assholes in this world.

785
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:31,515
We could disappear, all right.
Just start again.

786
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:33,100
- Start a new family.
- I have a son.

787
00:56:33,183 --> 00:56:34,851
He's a fucking Supe freak.

788
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,317
Fuck. Listen, I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

789
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:48,240
Becca. Becca, please. Come with me.

790
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,284
You were wrong about me, do you know that?

791
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:54,288
You put me on this pedestal,

792
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,958
and the truth is
I never knew how to save you.

793
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:00,210
You were always one bad day away

794
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:02,671
from pounding someone to death
in a parking lot.

795
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:06,800
- That's not true.
- Billy.

796
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:09,386
He raped me.

797
00:57:10,012 --> 00:57:13,140
And when I found out I was pregnant,
I went to Vought.

798
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:16,518
I didn't come to you.

799
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:21,189
I didn't come to you
because I was scared.

800
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,692
I knew that you'd chase after him,

801
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,445
and you would seek revenge,
and it wouldn't be good for anybody.

802
00:57:27,613 --> 00:57:29,781
- I love you.
- I love you. [SOBS]

803
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:36,913
But the hate that you carry
and the warpath that you're on...

804
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:41,209
it started so long before me.

805
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:44,378
I can't...

806
00:57:56,933 --> 00:58:00,687
- Becs. No, I'm not leaving without you.
- You have to go. Please.

807
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:06,193
Every guard in this goddamn place
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

808
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:08,904
You have to go.

809
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,410
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

810
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:35,138
Oh, shit.

811
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:49,820
- Small token of the trip.
- Mm.

812
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:51,988
John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

813
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:54,574
- when he was a birthday clown.
- Whatever, I still love them.

814
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:57,911
Thanks for letting me come.

815
00:58:57,994 --> 00:59:02,541
It was fun until it got so horrible.

816
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:04,710
Yeah. What can I say? It's my speciality.

817
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:05,793
[CHUCKLES]

818
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:13,301
Well, listen, if you're ever in the mood
for another Almond Joy,

819
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:17,139
just shoot me a text.
That came out so gross, I'm sorry.

820
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:18,390
Hughie...

821
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:22,561
We can't do that again.

822
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,480
No. No, no, no. No, we can't.

823
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:28,859
Why, though? I mean, the...

824
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:31,361
This is good.

825
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:33,280
But that's just it.

826
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:40,078
I mean, we can't afford to feel good,
or to feel safe, or to let our guard down.

827
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:42,122
But you can't go through this on your own.

828
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:48,587
We're all alone. That's the truth.

829
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:52,257
It doesn't have to be like that.

830
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,683
Goodbye, Hughie.

831
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,540
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

832
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:30,420
is to be willing
to do anything for your man.

833
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:32,631
Anything.

834
01:00:33,924 --> 01:00:38,345
I'm a feminist, but I'm also very sexual.

835
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:42,265
And I don't see that as contradictory.

836
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:48,980
What's wrong with giving pleasure?
And receiving it?

837
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:54,152
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.
Yeah, we appreciate your candour.

838
01:00:55,904 --> 01:00:56,988
[DEEP] Thank you so much.

839
01:00:57,072 --> 01:01:00,617
Anytime. It was really great meeting you.
Really great.

840
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,202
So great.

841
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:08,624
Bye.

842
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,505
[CHUCKLES] Her. Gianna. I choose her.

843
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,882
I mean, she's the one. No question.

844
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:19,135
- [CAROL] No, she isn't.
- Wait, what?

845
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:22,931
She was, like, hands down the winner.
It was not even a contest.

846
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,850
It's Cassandra.

847
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:26,852
Cassandra? The one...?

848
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:30,564
The one with the hair and the creepy
skeletons hugging each other story?

849
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:32,524
Yes. That's your wife.

850
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:34,108
[GROANS]

851
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,071
But I thought I got to choose.

852
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:43,159
You do. And you're choosing Cassandra.
Congratulations.

853
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,621
Yeah, but... I mean, Gianna...

854
01:01:46,705 --> 01:01:50,709
Is lovely. She's lovely.
She's a valued member of The Collective.

855
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:54,963
But this marriage
isn't about satisfying your base desires.

856
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:59,634
It's about rehabilitating your image
and getting you back in The Seven.

857
01:02:00,343 --> 01:02:02,304
That is what you want, isn't it?

858
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:23,283
There you are.

859
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:32,500
I was beginning to worry.

860
01:02:41,885 --> 01:02:43,678
Oh, I missed you.

861
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:54,397
Are you thirsty? Want some?

862
01:02:57,984 --> 01:03:00,195
Oh, I want you so bad.

863
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:08,787
Are you okay?

864
01:03:10,497 --> 01:03:12,290
Would you like me to be someone else?

865
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,168
I can be whoever you want.

866
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:23,592
No.

867
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,390
I don't need anyone...

868
01:03:31,518 --> 01:03:32,602
but myself.

869
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:50,370
Like what you see?

870
01:03:52,706 --> 01:03:54,290
See how hot you are?

871
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:57,042
Hmm?

872
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:01,214
Come on.

873
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,802
How much do you want this?

874
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:09,723
How much?

875
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:21,234
I'm gonna suck your cock so fucking hard.

876
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:23,194
So good.

877
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:27,449
You're gonna look in your own eyes
when you come.

878
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:34,122
And it's not even gay
if it's with yourself, right?

879
01:04:38,168 --> 01:04:40,920
Oh, you're so special.

880
01:04:41,963 --> 01:04:46,801
The most special man on the planet.

881
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:49,929
Everybody loves you.

882
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:52,891
Everybody.

883
01:04:54,476 --> 01:05:00,273
Their love is your strength.

884
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:13,369
You're pathetic.

885
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,219
I don't need everyone to love me.

886
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:32,722
I don't need anyone.

887
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:42,690
I don't need you!
